\section{Tile 1}\label{app:Chapter2}
Some equation:
\begin{equation}
g(n,k) = kg(n-1,k)+(n+k+2)g(n-1,k-1)
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of leaf nodes and $k$ is the number of levels in the hierarchy ranging between $1$ and $n-1$. An important feature to note about this enumeration is that it is super-factorial. That is:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} g(n,k) = \Omega (n!)
\end{equation}
